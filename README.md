PeerPaste Desktop
=================

This is the desktop edition of PeerPaste, a program that allows cut & paste between peers on a network. It is the companion application for the mobile PeerPaste app, which is currently available for Android on the Google Play Store.

Features:

* Automatic service discovery -- once a device starts the app, other devices on the same local network will discover it automatically, so no configuration is needed.
* Encrypted data -- the content that is pasted is encrypted in transit.
* Peer-to-peer key sharing -- the encryption keys are shared via scanning of out-of-band QR codes. There is no dependency on any centralized authority.
* Completely cloudless -- Apart from the initial install (and any voluntary updates), no external servers are involved.

## How to install

First you need to have Java 8 installed on your machine. Then download `peerpaste.jar` and optionally download the shell script `peerpaste-server`. The jar will work on any machine that supports Java 8. The shell script will work on any machine that supports POSIX shell.

## How to run

Run the command `./peerpaste-server`. Bla bla bla service name.
